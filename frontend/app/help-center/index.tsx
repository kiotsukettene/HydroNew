      question: "What types of plants can I grow in this system?",
answer: "This system is designed exclusively for growing lettuce. It is optimized for various fast-growing, leafy varieties such as Romaine, Butterhead, and Loose-leaf types, which perform best in this hydroponic setup."    },
    {
      question: "Does the UV filter need regular maintenance or replacement?",
      answer: "Yes, the UV filter requires regular maintenance. It should be cleaned monthly and replaced every 6-12 months depending on usage. Regular maintenance ensures optimal water purification and system efficiency."
    },
    {
      question: "What type of wastewater can I use?",
      answer: "The system is designed for greywater, which comes from household activities like showers, sinks, and laundry. Greywater is safer to recycle because it usually contains soaps, mild organic matter, and nutrients that can be treated and reused for hydroponics."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I monitor the system remotely if I'm away from home?",
      answer: "Yes, the system includes remote monitoring capabilities through our mobile app. You can check water quality, pH levels, nutrient concentrations, and system status from anywhere. You'll also receive notifications for any issues that require attention."
